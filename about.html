    <!-- WHAT IS APDA -->
    <section id="apda" class="glass-card">
      <h3 class="about-header">What is APDA?</h3>

      <p class="about-preview">
        The American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) is a collegiate debate league that emphasizes clear analysis and persuasive speaking over reading evidence at high speed. Rounds feature two-person teams on each side: the <em>Government</em> proposes a case and the <em>Opposition</em> responds.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subhead">Teams & Speaker Roles</h4>
      <ul class="section-list">
        <li><strong>Government (Gov)</strong>: Prime Minister (PM) and Member of Government (MG)</li>
        <li><strong>Opposition (Opp)</strong>: Leader of the Opposition (LO) and Member of the Opposition (MO)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subhead">Speech Order & Times</h4>
      <div class="time-row">
        <span class="chip">PMC 7:00</span>
        <span class="chip">LOC 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">MG 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">MO 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">LOR 4:00</span>
        <span class="chip">PMR 5:00</span>
      </div>
      <p class="note">Constructive speeches allow Points of Information (POIs) except in the first and last minute (“protected time”). Rebuttals do not take POIs.</p>

      <h4 class="subhead">How Rounds Are Judged</h4>
      <ul class="section-list">
        <li>Judges weigh comparative persuasion: which side better supports and compares its claims.</li>
        <li>Clarity, structure, and weighing matter more than quoted evidence.</li>
        <li>Gov presents a clear case in the PMC; Opp refutes and offers counter-analysis.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- MEETINGS -->
    <section id="meetings" class="glass-card">
      <h3 class="about-header">Meetings</h3>

    <!-- TOURNAMENTS -->
    <section id="tournaments" class="glass-card">
      <h3 class="about-header">Tournaments (APDA)</h3>
      <p class="about-preview">
        Tournaments are multi-day events hosted by colleges on the APDA circuit. Most run Friday–Saturday, with the occasional Sunday finish. Fields can be large—often hundreds of competitors.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <h4 class="subhead">Sign-Up &amp; Selection</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            Two weeks before each tournament, the E-Board sends an interest form. Use it to confirm you want to attend and to request a preferred partner and team name. Interest does not guarantee a seat; spots are limited. Selection follows the minimum attendance policy and weighs commitment, experience, and learning opportunity.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Information &amp; Logistics</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            Once the roster is set, the Operations Director publishes a Tournament Information Document (TID). It includes timings, transportation, lodging, and other essentials. The TID is a living document—check it regularly. It will be emailed to attendees, posted on the website, and stored in the team’s Global Google Drive. All travel and lodging costs are covered by the club.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 class="subhead">How Tournaments Work</h4>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li><strong>Preliminary (“in”) rounds:</strong> Usually 5–7 qualifiers. Depending on field size, teams typically need to win about 60–80% of these to “break” to elimination rounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Elimination (“out”) rounds:</strong> Knockout rounds (usually 3–4) determine finalists and the champion.</li>
            <li><strong>Speaks &amp; ranks:</strong> Each debater receives speaker points (“speaks”) for performance—clarity, argumentation, organization, and stamina—and a rank within the round.</li>
            <li><strong>Judging:</strong> Qualified, experienced judges “flow” the round, weigh comparative strength and relevance, award speaks, and determine the winner.</li>
            <li><strong>Pairing:</strong> A tournament tabulation system (“Tab”) pairs teams each round based on records and other constraints.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="subhead">After the Tournament</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            You’ll receive your results and can review performance with your partner and the team. This is the time to refine cases, adjust strategies, and set goals for the next event.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Extras</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            Tournaments typically provide lunch on Day 1 and breakfast/lunch on Day 2. They’re also a chance to see new campuses and cities, meet debaters from across the country, and broaden your college experience.

    <!-- ATTENDANCE -->
    <section id="attendance" class="glass-card">
      <h3 class="about-header">Attendance</h3>
      <p class="about-preview">
        Attendance at PDU isn’t mandatory. We build around your pace and schedule—especially during busy weeks. That said, participation matters. Members who put in more time at practices and trainings receive priority for limited opportunities (like tournament spots).
      </p>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <h4 class="subhead">Tournament Eligibility (Global Policy)</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">To be considered for a tournament, you must meet these minimums in the three weeks before the interest form deadline:</p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>1 Monday Lesson Meeting</li>
            <li>2 Wednesday Training Meetings</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="about-preview">Attending more than the minimum improves your chances when seats are limited.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 class="subhead">Voting Eligibility</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">To vote in Board elections, you must attend at least 60% of meetings in the semester.</p>

          <h4 class="subhead" style="margin-top:.75rem;">Tracking &amp; Accountability</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            At the start of each meeting, check in on the tablet to record your attendance. The attendance sheet is visible to members so you can track your own record and standing. Any disputes should be filed with the Operations Director.
          </p>

    <!-- EQUITY -->
    <section id="equity" class="glass-card">
      <h3 class="about-header">Equity</h3>
      <p class="about-preview">
        Equity is a core value of APDA—and of PDU. Debate can be fast, competitive, and emotionally charged. Our goal is a space where everyone can challenge ideas without harming people. This policy applies to practices, tournaments, socials, and all online team spaces.
      </p>

      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <h4 class="subhead">Principles</h4>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li><strong>Respect first.</strong> Debate ideas, not identities.</li>
            <li><strong>Safety over spectacle.</strong> No case or tactic is worth making someone feel targeted or unsafe.</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability.</strong> We correct mistakes, learn, and do better next time.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="subhead">Non-Discrimination</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">Discrimination or harassment based on identity or status is prohibited. That includes slurs, coded language, demeaning stereotypes, or arguments that justify harm against a person or group.</p>
          <p class="about-preview"><strong>Examples (not exhaustive):</strong></p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li><strong>Not allowed:</strong> “X group is inherently dishonest,” “Women are less rational,” “Deportation is justified because [group] is dangerous.”</li>
            <li><strong>Allowed (with care):</strong> Policy arguments supported by analysis/evidence that do not target identities (e.g., “This proposal increases harm to undocumented communities because…”).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="subhead">Generalizations in Arguments</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">Avoid blanket claims about groups. Use precise, reasoned analysis.</p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li><strong>Not allowed:</strong> “People on welfare are lazy.”</li>
            <li><strong>Stronger approach:</strong> “This policy may reduce work incentives because [mechanism], which affects labor supply.”</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h4 class="subhead">Sportsmanship &amp; Conduct</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">Intimidation, insults, condescension, mocking accents, misgendering, or hostile behavior toward debaters or judges is not allowed—during or after rounds, in halls, group chats, or social events.</p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li><strong>Not allowed:</strong> Personal attacks (“You’re stupid”), sarcastic belittling of a speaker, repeated mispronouncing of a name after correction.</li>
            <li><strong>Expected:</strong> Firm clash on arguments, respectful tone, correct names and pronouns.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="subhead">Tournament Equity</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">Each tournament announces its Equity Policy and the Equity Team at opening assembly. Follow host rules for reporting and resolution. If in doubt, ask the Equity Team or a PDU officer—immediately.</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">PDU Reporting &amp; Support</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            PDU has an Equity Officer (see the <a href="leadership.html">Leadership</a> page) who:
          </p>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>receives confidential reports,</li>
            <li>mediates disputes and team culture concerns,</li>
            <li>coordinates with tournament Equity if needed.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="about-preview">
            <strong>How to report:</strong> Speak to the Equity Officer, any board member, or use the reporting channel provided in the Tournament Information Document. No retaliation for good-faith reports.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Equity in Rounds: Content Notes &amp; Opt-Outs</h4>
          <p class="about-preview">
            Before the case is read, the Government must give a brief content note if topics may be sensitive (e.g., sexual violence, suicide, self-harm, child abuse, hate crimes, graphic violence). When unsure, include the note.
          </p>
          <p class="about-preview">
            <strong>Opt-out:</strong> If any debater or the judge opts out, Gov must present an alternative case and motion. No penalty for opting out. Keep it quick, professional, and move on.
          </p>
          <p class="about-preview">
            <strong>During round:</strong> If a concern arises, pause and state it clearly. Judges may consult Equity per host policy.
          </p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Consequences</h4>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>Informal coaching or a corrective conversation.</li>
            <li>Formal warning and documentation with PDU and, if applicable, tournament Equity.</li>
            <li>Competitive remedies (e.g., loss of speaker eligibility for an event, removal from a round, or disqualification per host rules).</li>
            <li>Team remedies (e.g., suspension from practices/tournaments, loss of leadership eligibility, or membership termination).</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 class="subhead">Our Commitments</h4>
          <ul class="section-list">
            <li>Use names and pronouns correctly.</li>
            <li>Make reasonable accommodations (access needs, pacing, breaks).</li>
            <li>Pair thoughtfully and support newer members.</li>
            <li>Choose cases that challenge ideas without targeting identities.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="about-preview">
            Questions or concerns? Reach out to the Equity Officer or the Operations Director—earlier is better.
