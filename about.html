        The <strong>Parliamentary Debate Union (PDU)</strong> at New York University is a student-run club devoted to competitive debate, intellectual growth, and team camaraderie.
        We represent NYU on the <strong>American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA)</strong> circuit — a collegiate league of debate teams from universities across the East Coast and beyond.
        <br><br>
        Each weekend, we send teams to tournaments at colleges like Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, fully funded and supported. PDU covers all travel expenses for competing members, including transportation, registration, and lodging.
        <br><br>
        Beyond competition, PDU offers weekly training workshops, practice debates, and mentorship. We welcome everyone — from seasoned debaters to complete beginners — and provide the tools, strategies, and community to help every member succeed.
        <br><br>
        Debate with us, grow with us, and find your voice at NYU.

    <!-- WHAT IS APDA -->

      <h3 class="about-header">What is APDA?</h3>

      <p class="about-preview">
        The <strong>American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA)</strong> is a university debate league that emphasizes clear argumentation and rhetoric over cited evidence or speed reading. Rounds feature two-person teams on each side: the <em>Government</em> proposes a case and the <em>Opposition</em> responds. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
      </p>

      <h4 class="subhead">Teams & Speaker Roles</h4>
      <ul class="section-list">
        <li><strong>Government (Gov)</strong>: <em>Prime Minister (PM)</em> and <em>Member of Government (MG)</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Opposition (Opp)</strong>: <em>Leader of the Opposition (LO)</em> and <em>Member of the Opposition (MO)</em>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subhead">Speech Order & Times</h4>
      <div class="time-row">
        <span class="chip">PMC 7:00</span>
        <span class="chip">LOC 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">MG 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">MO 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">LOR 4:00</span>
        <span class="chip">PMR 5:00</span>
      </div>
      <p class="note">Speeches include a 30-second grace period at the end. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}</p>

      <h4 class="subhead">Points of Information (POIs)</h4>
      <p class="about-preview">
        During constructive speeches, the opposing team may briefly stand to ask a question or make a challenge. POIs are allowed <em>after the first minute and before the last minute</em> of each constructive speech (“protected time”); they’re not permitted during rebuttals. Accepting a few POIs is considered good form. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
      </p>

      <h4 class="subhead">How Rounds Are Judged</h4>
      <ul class="section-list">
        <li>Judges evaluate <strong>comparative persuasion</strong>: which side better supports and weighs its claims.</li>
        <li>APDA prioritizes <strong>analysis and rhetoric</strong> rather than quoted evidence. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}</li>
        <li>Gov presents a clear case in the PMC; Opp refutes and offers counter-analysis.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="about-preview">
        If you’re new, don’t worry—most tournaments offer novice-friendly coaching and resources. We’ll guide you through your first rounds.
