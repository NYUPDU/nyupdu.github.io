        The Parliamentary Debate Union (PDU) at New York University is a student-run club devoted to competitive debate, intellectual growth, and team camaraderie. We represent NYU on the American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) circuit, a collegiate league of debate teams from universities across the East Coast and beyond.
      </p>
      <p class="about-preview">
        Each weekend, we send teams to tournaments at colleges like Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, fully funded and supported. PDU covers all travel expenses for competing members, including transportation, registration, and lodging.
      </p>
      <p class="about-preview">
        Beyond competition, PDU offers weekly training workshops, practice debates, and mentorship. We welcome everyone from seasoned debaters to complete beginners and provide the tools, strategies, and community to help every member succeed.

    <!-- WHAT IS APDA -->

      <h3 class="about-header">What is APDA?</h3>

      <p class="about-preview">
        The American Parliamentary Debate Association (APDA) is a collegiate debate league that emphasizes clear analysis and persuasive speaking over reading evidence at high speed. Rounds feature two-person teams on each side: the <em>Government</em> proposes a case and the <em>Opposition</em> responds.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subhead">Teams & Speaker Roles</h4>
      <ul class="section-list">
        <li><strong>Government (Gov)</strong>: Prime Minister (PM) and Member of Government (MG)</li>
        <li><strong>Opposition (Opp)</strong>: Leader of the Opposition (LO) and Member of the Opposition (MO)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subhead">Speech Order & Times</h4>
      <div class="time-row">
        <span class="chip">PMC 7:00</span>
        <span class="chip">LOC 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">MG 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">MO 8:00</span>
        <span class="chip">LOR 4:00</span>
        <span class="chip">PMR 5:00</span>
      </div>
      <p class="note">Constructive speeches allow Points of Information (POIs) except in the first and last minute (“protected time”). Rebuttals do not take POIs.</p>

      <h4 class="subhead">How Rounds Are Judged</h4>
      <ul class="section-list">
        <li>Judges weigh comparative persuasion: which side better supports and compares its claims.</li>
        <li>Clarity, structure, and weighing matter more than quoted evidence.</li>
        <li>Gov presents a clear case in the PMC; Opp refutes and offers counter-analysis.</li>
      </ul>
